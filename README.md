## Project Overview
AIPrepView is an innovative interview preparation platform that uses AI to simulate real job interviews. It combines voice recognition, conversational AI, and performance analytics to help candidates practice and improve their interview skills in a realistic environment.

## Key Features
- üéôÔ∏è **Real-time Voice Interviewing** - Practice with an AI interviewer that speaks and listens
- üìä **Detailed Feedback Reports** - Get scores and insights across 5 key interview categories
- üî• **Firebase Authentication** - Secure user accounts with email/password
- üõ†Ô∏è **Interview Customization** - Choose role, tech stack, and question type
- üì± **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üåì **Dark/Light Mode** - Built-in theme support

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- **Voice AI API:** Vapi SDK
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Icons & UI:** Lucide, Sonner (toast alerts)

## AI/Voice Interview Logic
The interview flow is powered by VAPI.ai with the following architecture:

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks responses which are transcribed in real-time
2. **AI Processing**: 
   - Questions are generated using Google Gemini
   - Conversation context is maintained throughout the interview
3. **Feedback Generation**: 
   - Transcript is analyzed across 5 categories
   - Scores and improvement suggestions are generated
4. **Voice Output**: 
   - AI interviewer responds with natural speech (11Labs voice)
   - Follow-up questions adapt to user responses

```typescript
// Sample interview assistant configuration
const interviewer: CreateAssistantDTO = {
  name: "Interviewer",
  transcriber: {
    provider: "deepgram",
    model: "nova-2",
    language: "en",
  },
  voice: {
    provider: "11labs",
    voiceId: "sarah",
    stability: 0.4,
    similarityBoost: 0.8
  },
  model: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [/* system prompts */]
  }
};
